#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: In my experience, Shopee offers clearer and more user-friendly filtering choices. This means it's easier to narrow down your search and locate the exact products you want.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: Both Shopee and Lazada show deals and promos sometimes, but Lazada has more distractions with lots of offers popping up while you're browsing.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee's setup is straightforward and easy to browse. They have clear categories and simple product listings, making it quicker to find what you want. Lazada can feel crowded because of all the promotions and content, which can slow down the search process.

<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Interface Analysis:**

-   Is the websitesâ€™ layout and design visually pleasing and consistent with their brand?<br/>
    Answer: Shopee and Lazada both keep their look and feel consistent. Shopee's style is colorful and fun, appealing to a younger crowd. Lazada goes for a cleaner, more professional appearance.
    
-   Comment on the responsiveness of both websites across different devices.<br/>
    Answer: Personally, both Shopee and Lazada work well on different devices like computers, tablets, and phones. But Shopee usually feels smoother and easier to use no matter what size screen you're on.
    
-   Which do you think is better when it comes to the visual aspect of the website?<br/>
    Answer: The preference for the visual aspect of a website is subjective and varies depending on individual taste. Some users may prefer Shopee's colorful and energetic design, while others may favor Lazada's cleaner and more business-like interface. However, personally, I lean towards Shopee's visual style because it's user-friendly and beginner-friendly, with visuals that are easy to understand.
